# COSC 2P08 - Lab01: Learning how to use Git and GitClassroom

This repository is designed to help you learn the basics of using Git, Python, and testing with `pytest`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or later
- `pip` (Python package manager)
- `git` (for version control)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd hello-world-python
   ```

2. Install `pytest`:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python hello_world.py
   ```

4. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

### Files in this Repository

- **`hello_world.py`**: A Python script that prints "Hello, World!".
- **`test_hello_world.py`**: A test script to validate the output of `hello_world.py`.
- **`README.md`**: Instructions for using this repository.

## Learning Objectives

- Use Git to clone a repository and track changes.
- Write and run Python scripts.
- Test Python scripts using `pytest`.

### How to Set Up the Repository Structure

Your repository should have the following structure:

```
hello-world-python/
├── hello_world.py
├── test_hello_world.py
├── README.md
```

### Instructions for Lab Instructors
- Direct students to clone the repository and explore the files.
- Guide them to run the Python script to see the output.
- Explain the purpose of `pytest` and walk them through running the tests.
